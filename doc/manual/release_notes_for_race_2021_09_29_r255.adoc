* {empty}
CARMA should now automatically recover from broken connections that are
reported via the `{rsdk_CONNECTION_CLOSED}` or
`{rsdk_CONNECTION_INIT_FAILED}` events.
New connections should now be opened in response to these events.

* {empty}
CARMA now has its first iteration of registration servers.
The current behavior is that when a client node detects that it has no
links to its mailbox server, it will create one or more dynamic links
and send them to its mailbox server via the registration servers.
Note that this only applies to `{rsdk_CT_INDIRECT}` channels.

* {empty}
As a summary of this update, CARMA should still function normally when
given no genesis options, primarily relying on the
`{rsdk_getLinksForPersonas}` function to discover links.
In order to test dynamic links (for a `{rsdk_CT_INDIRECT}` channel),
genesis options such as
`{rsdk_ta1_custom_args}='{cro_dynamic_only}="client"'` (matches all
clients) or
`{rsdk_ta1_custom_args}='{cro_dynamic_only}="client-0000[1-3]"'`
(matches clients 1 to 3) can be used.

* {empty}
Added the `{cro_dynamic_only}[=<regex>]` genesis option.
Currently, this option makes the matching nodes only use dynamic links
for non-`{rsdk_LT_RECV}` links, except for the purpose of sending
messages to the registration servers.
In other words, the matching nodes will never call the
`{rsdk_getLinksForPersonas}` function for `{rsdk_LT_SEND}` or
`{rsdk_LT_BIDI}` links for nodes that are not registration servers.
+
This option can be specified multiple times to specify multiple regular
expressions to match against.
Omitting `=<regex>` is equivalent to specifying `=".*"`, which will
match all nodes.
+
Note that since RACE names its client nodes `race-client-XXXXX`,
specifying `{cro_dynamic_only}="client"` is an easy way to match all
client nodes.
+
*NB: Only client nodes have dynamic link support at this time.
Matching a non-client node will cause that node to be unable to send
messages, which may cause dropped end-to-end messages.*

* {empty}
Replaced the `--mb-threshold`, `--mc-threshold`, `--mc-good-size`, and
`--num-mc-groups` genesis options with the `{cro_mb_count}`,
`{cro_mc_count}`, and `{cro_mc_group_size}` options.
Also added the `{cro_reg_count}` genesis option to specify the expected
number of servers that will become registration servers.
+
These options should usually be omitted so that they use their default
values.
The default values are documented in the attached PDF.
