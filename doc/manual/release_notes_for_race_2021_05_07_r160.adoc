Use any number of clients, at least 10 servers, and at least one
indirect channel.
The minimum number of servers is 6, but using fewer servers increases
the probability that all server selection trials will fail during config
generation.

* {blank}
OpenTracing is now (re)integrated into our updated MPC protocol.

* {blank}
Links are now probabilistically prioritized by various metrics.

* {blank}
Sends for which success has not been reported via the
`onPackageStatusChanged` API will now be probabilistically attempted to
be resent up to 5 times over 5 minutes, sometimes trying other links.

* {blank}
An issue where messages over a certain size were immediately failing to

Messages up to 140 bytes in size are now supported again.
Please note that persona names are currently limited to 32 bytes.
