* {blank}
Fixed an oversight where a multicast link that was initially discovered
via a unicast `getLinksForPersonas()` call would never be amended to be
marked multicast after learning more information about the link.

* {blank}
Fixed an oversight where certain multicast send opportunities were being
ignored when the actual receiver set is a strict superset of the desired
receiver set.

* {blank}
Fixed an unlikely bug where certain multicast sends could possibly send
to an incorrect receiver set, i.e., a receiver set that is not a
superset of the desired receiver set, which could cause a stalled mix.
