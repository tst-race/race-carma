* {blank}
Added multiple management committees.
Each committee maintains a separate mix counter, which has a side effect
of making it more difficult to determine when a `ClrMsg` will make it
through to the final recipient.
We recommend sending 4 copies of every `ClrMsg` (the default mix size)
to ensure that a mix always occurs when testing.

* {blank}
The default `generate_configs.sh` settings should now be reasonable in
arbitrarily large deployments, with the total number of links being
reduced by up to a factor of 100.

* {blank}
Multicast links will be used by certain parts of the CARMA protocol if
available.

* {blank}
Dynamic links are not being utilized yet.

* {blank}
The `carma-draw` utility is being updated to accomodate the new changes.
See the work in progress image attached.
