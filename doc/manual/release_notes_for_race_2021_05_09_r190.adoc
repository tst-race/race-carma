* {blank}
Use any number of clients, at least 10 servers, and at least one
indirect channel.
The minimum number of servers is actually 6, but using fewer servers
increases the probability that all server selection trials will fail
during config generation.

* {blank}
Fixed a bug that could cause the time field of a `ClrMsg` to be
incorrect.

* {blank}
Fixed a cross-node race condition that could cause ``ClrMsg```'s to
shadow each other, resulting in some ``ClrMsg```'s being dropped and
others being duplicated.

* {blank}
Refined the tracing events for better log analysis, in particular
regarding `EncPkg` routing.
