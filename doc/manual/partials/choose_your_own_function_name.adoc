Although the name `{vjeaduep}` is used for this function throughout this
manual, you should give this function a unique name of your own choosing
to help prevent name collisions with other code.
The usual approach is to use a unique prefix on this name (and any other
names your plugin uses).
For example, if your plugin were named Foo, you could use `foo_` as a
unique prefix and name this function `foo_{vjeaduep_name0}`.
